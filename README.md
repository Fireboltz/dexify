# Dexify

## What is Dexify? :sparkles:

In life there are lot of problems one faces which might lead to people getting addicted to stuff ranging from coffee/tea to even drugs. This disturbs the mental health of a person on a fundamental level and also has a bitter impact to their life. A lot of people become aware of this and try to get out of this situation by going to deaddiction centre or by becoming parts of support groups. 

But during this time of the pandemic, when people need to maintain social distancing performing such activites is not possible. People who might have beeen trying their best to recover, have suddenly been plunged into staying at their homes all day and in a lot of cases with little to no support. We belive no one should face such hardships, and this is the problem we aim to solve with Dexify. 

Dexify is a deaddiction and a community mental health tracking app. It has the ability to monitor one's mood and day to day acitvities. It does not just stops with tracking it but also helps to improve the mood of the user and keep them positive and motivated.
